    "1. For example, we might collect data from many patient with \"small\" data and domain adaptation is used to generalized to new patients. Therefore, extracting these relationships is of practical importance.\n",
    "2. Meanwhile, the relationship between domains can also be learned, which is of interest in addition to classification performance.\n",
    "3. The encoder E maps data points x to feature vectors E(x). These features are then used by local classifier to make predications for supervised task. They are also  used  by the domain adapter, encouraging extracted features E(x) to be similar across __neary domains.__"
